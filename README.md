# Eniac's A/B Test

## Summary
This project focuses on enhancing Eniac’s website user experience through A/B testing to increase conversions and boost iPhone 13 sales. By evaluating different designs of the "SHOP NOW" button, we aim to identify which version drives the highest click-through rate (CTR).

## Languages and Tools Used
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Learnings
- Gained proficiency in data collection, cleaning, and hypothesis testing.
- Developed skills in A/B testing methodologies and statistical analysis.

## Challenges Overcame
- Addressed low conversion rates (2%) on the original "SHOP NOW" button by testing four variations:
  - **Version A**: White “SHOP NOW”
  - **Version B**: Red “SHOP NOW”
  - **Version C**: White “SEE DEALS”
  - **Version D**: Red “SEE DEALS”

## Additional Reflections
The analysis revealed that Version C exhibited a statistically significant CTR compared to Versions B and D. Both Versions A and C can be considered winners, but further metrics and qualitative insights are needed for a definitive choice. This project underscored the importance of data-driven decision-making in optimizing user experience for increased sales.
